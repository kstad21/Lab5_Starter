1. I would not use a unit test to test the whole of the "message" feature of a messaging application. This is because the test passing or failing doesn't actually tell us much. If the test fails, it was so broad in the first place we don't know what went wrong along the way. If it passes, we know that in this one case we can send a message from one end to another.
2. Yes. This is because this is a specific test that gives us good information. If it fails, we know where the problem is, and this is much more helpful for finding and debugging bugs.
